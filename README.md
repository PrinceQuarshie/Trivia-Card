# Trivia-Card
In this project the user is able to read the clue, view an optional hint, and select their answer.
a few different effects were added to this project. A hint box will slide up and down. When you click an incorrect answer, 
it will fade away and a frowny face will appear. When you click the correct answer,
the frowny face will disappear and a smiley face will take its place.
